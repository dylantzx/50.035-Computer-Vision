In this section we will start by building a model with basic TensorFlow constructs to help you better understand what's going on under the hood of the higher-level APIs.\n",
        "\n",
        "**\"Barebones Tensorflow\" is important to understanding the building blocks of TensorFlow, but much of it involves concepts from TensorFlow 1.x.** We will be working with legacy modules such as `tf.Variable`.\n",

        "\n",
        "TensorFlow 1.x is primarily a framework for working with **static computational graphs**. Nodes in the computational graph are Tensors which will hold n-dimensional arrays when the graph is run; edges in the graph represent functions that will operate on Tensors when the graph is run to actually perform useful computation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Before Tensorflow 2.0, we had to configure the graph into two phases. There are plenty of tutorials online that explain this two-step process. The process generally looks like the following for TF 1.x:\n",
        "1. **Build a computational graph that describes the computation that you want to perform**. This stage doesn't actually perform any computation; it just builds up a symbolic representation of your computation. This stage will typically define one or more `placeholder` objects that represent inputs to the computational graph.\n",
        "2. **Run the computational graph many times.** Each time the graph is run (e.g. for one gradient descent step) you will specify which parts of the graph you want to compute, and pass a `feed_dict` dictionary that will give concrete values to any `placeholder`s in the graph.\n",
        "\n",
        "### The new paradigm in Tensorflow 2.0\n",
        "Now, with Tensorflow 2.0, we can simply adopt a functional form that is more Pythonic and similar in spirit to PyTorch and direct Numpy operation. Instead of the 2-step paradigm with computation graphs, making it (among other things) easier to debug TF code. You can read more details at https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/eager.\n",
        "\n",
        "The main difference between the TF 1.x and 2.0 approach is that the 2.0 approach doesn't make use of `tf.Session`, `tf.run`, `placeholder`, `feed_dict`. To get more details of what's different between the two version and how to convert between the two, check out the official migration guide: https://www.tensorflow.org/alpha/guide/migration_guide\n",

When we use fully connected affine layers to process the image, however, we want each datapoint to be represented by a single vector -- it's no longer useful to segregate the different channels, rows, and columns of the data. So, we use a \"flatten\" operation to collapse the `H x W x C` values per representation into a single long vector. \n",

        "You should experiment with architectures, hyperparameters, loss functions, regularization, or anything else you can think of to train a model that achieves **at least 70%** accuracy on the **validation** set within 10 epochs. You can use the built-in train function, the `train_part34` function from above, or implement your own training loop.\n",
        "\n",
        "Describe what you did at the end of the notebook.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Some things you can try:\n",
        "- **Filter size**: Above we used 5x5 and 3x3; is this optimal?\n",
        "- **Number of filters**: Above we used 16 and 32 filters. Would more or fewer do better?\n",
        "- **Pooling**: We didn't use any pooling above. Would this improve the model?\n",
        "- **Normalization**: Would your model be improved with batch normalization, layer normalization, group normalization, or some other normalization strategy?\n",

BatchNorm and Dropout layers have different behaviors at training and inference time. `training` is a specific keyword argument reserved for this purpose in any `tf.keras.Model`'s `call()` function.

        "For each network architecture that you try, you should tune the learning rate and other hyperparameters. When doing this there are a couple important things to keep in mind: \n",
        "\n",
        "- If the parameters are working well, you should see improvement within a few hundred iterations\n",
        "- Remember the coarse-to-fine approach for hyperparameter tuning: start by testing a large range of hyperparameters for just a few training iterations to find the combinations of parameters that are working at all.\n",
        "- Once you have found some sets of parameters that seem to work, search more finely around these parameters. You may need to train for more epochs.\n",
        "- You should use the validation set for hyperparameter search, and save your test set for evaluating your architecture on the best parameters as selected by the validation set.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Going above and beyond\n",
        "If you are feeling adventurous there are many other features you can implement to try and improve your performance. You are **not required** to implement any of these, but don't miss the fun if you have time!\n",
        "\n",
        "- Alternative optimizers: you can try Adam, Adagrad, RMSprop, etc.\n",
        "- Alternative activation functions such as leaky ReLU, parametric ReLU, ELU, or MaxOut.\n",
        "- Model ensembles\n",
        "- Data augmentation\n",
        "- New Architectures\n",
        "  - [ResNets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) where the input from the previous layer is added to the output.\n",
